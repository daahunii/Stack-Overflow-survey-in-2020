->For five years running, Rust has taken the top spot as the most loved programming language. TypeScript is second surpassing Python compared to last year. We also see big gains in Go, moving up to 5th from 10th last year. 

VBA, Objective C, and Perl hold the top spots for the most dreaded languagesâ€”languages that had a high percentage of developers who are currently using them, but have no interest in continuing to do so. 

If we look at technologies that developers report that they do not use but want to learn, Python takes the top spot for the fourth year in a row. We also see some modest gains in the interest in learning Rust.
